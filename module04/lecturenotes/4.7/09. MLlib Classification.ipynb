    "**Introduction to Classification**\n",
    "\n",
    "Classification is a common form of supervised learning.  \n",
    "In supervised learning, the training examples include labels.  \n",
    "After training the model, the purpose of the task is to predict labels for new examples.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The data type of the $Y$ variable makes it a *classification problem*, namely $Y$ is a discrete variable.  \n",
    "Binary classification is most common. Examples include fraud (or not), default, survival, claim filing, spam.\n",
    "\n",
    "A continuous $Y$ variable results in a regression problem (next topic).\n",
    "\n",
    "Classification and regression both use the `LabeledPoint` class.  \n",
    "To remind ourselves, a `LabeledPoint` consists of a label and a features vector.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Follow this convention for labels:  \n",
    "- For binary classification, use labels $0$ and $1$  \n",
    "- For multiclass classification, use labels $0$, $1$, …, $C-1$ where $C$ is the number of classes  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Spark supports several popular models for classification including:  \n",
    "- Logistic regression  \n",
    "- Naive Bayes  \n",
    "- Tree methods (e.g., decision tree, random forest)  \n",
    "- Support Vector Machines  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Logistic regression**    \n",
    "This is currently the most popular method for binary classification.  \n",
    "It is a generalized linear model which uses a linear plane to separate positive and negative examples.  \n",
    "Although the model is relatively simple, the results can be very competitive.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Below is an example of some data and a logistic curve fit to the data. Probability of Passing $Y$ is a function of Hours Studying $X$.  Notice the $Y$ variable consists of the values 0, 1.\n",
